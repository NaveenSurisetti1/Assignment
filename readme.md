### README  

### Database Initialization, Data Insertion and Analysis Using Python Scripting

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3
- Pandas

Ensure Python, Pandas and SQLite are installed on your system.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Place the script in your desired directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
5. Run the script using the command: python3 <script_name>.py.

### Explaination for each script

#### 1. data_insert_to_db.py

This Python script, data_insert_to_db.py, is designed to initialize the SQLite database for Company XYZ. It creates tables relevant to the company's operations, including Customers, Sales, Items, and Orders, and then inserts dummy data into these tables to simulate real-world usage. Ideal for setting up a test environment or demo database.

#### 2. pandas_code.py
Uses Pandas to load data from an SQLite database into DataFrames, performs data manipulation to aggregate sales information by customer age and item, and saves the result to a CSV file. Requires the Pandas library.

#### 3. sql_query_with_pd.py
Executes a SQL query to aggregate sales data directly within the SQLite database and uses Pandas to load the query results into a DataFrame, which is then saved to a CSV file. This script combines SQL's data processing capabilities with Pandas' data handling and CSV export features.

#### 4. sql_query_without_pd.py
Performs data aggregation through a SQL query and exports the results to a CSV file without using Pandas. This script is ideal for environments where minimal external dependencies are preferred, relying solely on Python's standard library for database connection and CSV file handling.

Each script serves a specific role within the data handling and analysis workflow for Company XYZ, from initializing the database to performing sophisticated data aggregation and reporting.

### Additional analysis 

The execution times for each solution were meticulously measured, and a comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the efficiency of each approach in running the entire process. 

After careful consideration of both the execution times and alignment with the required use cases and usage scenarios, the most efficient solution should be implemented. This decision was driven by the goal to optimize performance and meet the specific demands and objectives outlined by the use cases and anticipated usage patterns.
